    <p>For the past few years, the dream of strengthening the presence of learning management system in India has gained significant pace.

    <ul>
        <li><b>Audio, video capabilities along with interactive content</b><p>
        Apart from text and picture description, an education LMS should be able to support audio, video and other file types (.swf, .doc, .avi, .wmv, .mpg etc). This is key and important for visual and audio learning.</p></li>
        <li><b>Easy to use on different devices</b><p>
        A learning management system in India should be easily customised for PCs/Laptops, Internet Tablets, and Mobile Phones. The different variants of this application offer the convenience of surfing despite on the move.</p></li>
        <li><b>Content capability</b><p>
        Users should be to restore the past session, which helps to save time. Just type the LMS URL to relaunch the app from the start.</p></li>
        <li><b>Web conferencing</b><p>
        It is a must have feature for LMS system as it can ensure effective distance teaching and learning.</p></li>
        <li><b>Multiple language support</b><p>
        This feature should be incorporated to boost the adoption as India is home to people from different cultural diversities. An LMS, which is capable of offering learning content in multiple languages, bolsters the adoption rate considerably.</p></li>
